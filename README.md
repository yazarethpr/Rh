# Rh

This is the data analysis script for Rhodium. This analysis yields a p-wave. 
The binning performed here consisted on averaging the number of counts according to the number of counts acquired per wavelenght directly
from the THAtec software frame. 
The errors were averaged following the corresponding error propagation. 
After getting some values for the threshold energy, they were Doppler shifted taking into account that they were acquired through colinear
propagation. 
Then the weighted and normal mean were taken for this energies and errors, leading to a final threshold energy value with its corresponding
statistical error. It is necessary to take into account the systematic errors associated to this measurement.
